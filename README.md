## üéØ What is BMAD Method?

BMAD Method is a revolutionary universal AI agent framework designed for agile, AI-driven development across multiple domains. Unlike traditional development approaches, BMAD eliminates planning inconsistency and context loss by employing specialized AI agents that work together as a cohesive team.

### üî• Key Innovations

- **Analyst Agent**: Conducts market research and competitive analysis
- **Product Manager Agent**: Creates detailed, consistent Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- **Architect Agent**: Designs system architecture with implementation guidance
- Advanced prompt engineering with human-in-the-loop refinement

#### 2. **Context-Engineered Development**
- **Scrum Master Agent**: Transforms high-level plans into hyper-detailed development stories
- Embeds full context, implementation details, and architectural guidance in every story
- Maintains consistency across the entire development lifecycle
